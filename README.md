# Data Science & AI Workspace

Welcome to the **Data Science & AI Workspace**! This repository is designed to provide a standard workspace environment for Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI projects. With this setup, anyone can easily clone the repository, open it in Visual Studio Code, and begin working on their projects right away.

---

## Features

- **Pre-configured Workspace**: A VSCode workspace with necessary extensions and folder structures for data science and AI projects.
- **Standardized Folder Structure**: A consistent structure across all projects to maintain clarity and organization.
- **Ready for GitHub**: Easily upload and share your projects.
- **Jupyter Support**: Jupyter notebooks ready for use directly in VSCode.
- **Version Control with Git**: Pre-initialized Git for seamless collaboration.

## Folder Structure

The following folder structure is recommended for projects:

```plaintext
Demo/
├── data/               # Folder to store datasets
├── docs/               # Documentation for your project
├── models/             # Machine Learning or AI models
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter Notebooks
├── pipeline/           # Scripts for data pipelines and automation
├── reports/            # Generated reports, plots, or visualizations
├── src/                # Source code for the project
│   ├── __init__.py     # Init file for the package
│   └── explore_data.py # Example script to explore datasets
└── utils/              # Utility scripts for various helper functions
```

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the workspace on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**: Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your machine.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal and clone the repository using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

3. Open the workspace in VSCode:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install Required Extensions**:
   - Open the workspace in VSCode, and it should automatically prompt you to install recommended extensions. These include Python, Jupyter, and Git support for VSCode.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment for dependency management. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   If any dependencies are required for the project (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib), you can create a `requirements.txt` file and use the following command to install them:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` is not available, manually install packages like so:
   
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

---

## Using the Workspace

- **Data Folder**: Place any datasets you will be working with inside the `data/` folder.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Store your Jupyter notebooks inside the `notebooks/` folder for easy access.
- **Source Code**: Write your scripts in the `src/` folder. For example, you can modify the provided `explore_data.py` to explore your dataset.

### Running a Python Script

To run a script (e.g., `explore_data.py`), use:

```bash
python src/explore_data.py
```

---

## Example: Exploring the Dataset

Below is an example of how to explore a dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("data/chipotle.tsv", delimiter='\t')

# Show the first few rows
print(data.head())
```
